Overview
This repository documents my journey through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Data Engineering Learning Path and hands-on labs completed on Qwiklabs. Each folder contains labs, quizzes, and exercises that explore essential concepts in data engineering on GCP, covering topics like data ingestion, transformation, processing, and storage.

Key Skills and Topics Covered
Data Storage and Management: Working with BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Datastore, and Bigtable for efficient data management.
Data Processing and Transformation: Leveraging Dataflow, Apache Beam, and Dataproc to create data pipelines.
Machine Learning Pipelines: Implementing ML models using AI Platform and Vertex AI.
Data Orchestration: Automating data workflows with Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow).
Data Ingestion and Streaming: Using Pub/Sub and Datastream for real-time data pipelines.
Security and Monitoring: Managing access with IAM and tracking system health with Cloud Monitoring.
